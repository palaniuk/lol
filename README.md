                <td><font face="tahoma" size="2">Hey everybody! Welcome to my little tribute to the greatest eSports game ever created, League of Legends! If you're looking for a game that can make you rage like a 5 year old, cause you to phone in sick to work at least once a month, make you wish you were from South Korea, or trains you to pee and poop only during loading screens, then you simply have to try Riot's League of Legends. A fair warning though, this game is not for the thin skinned. You <strong>will</strong> suck at times. People <strong>will</strong> scream at you and wish you dead. They <strong>will</strong> tell you to die in a fire or that your children should perish from the most horrific plague and then crushed by a bus. You <strong>might</strong> cry. You <strong>will</strong> quit, uninstall,  reinstall and try again. It's O.K. This is <strong>normal</strong>, we've all been there. Allow me to show you some of the great resources available for you so you may rise from  pleb to power house in this super fast paced and ultra competitive world! Unlike in the actual game, noobs are welcome here.</font>
